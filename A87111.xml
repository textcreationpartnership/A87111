            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

reproves them for their quick ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe

<hi>God hath given me the</hi> true knowledge
of things that are, <hi>ſo</hi> that I know how the
world was made, and the powers of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
The beginning and the end, and
the midſt of the times, how the times alter,
and the change of the ſeaſons: The courſe
of the yeare, the ſituation of the Starres,
the nature of living things, and the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of beaſts, the power of the winds,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119386:23"/>
and the imaginations of men, the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of plants, and the vertues of rootes;
and all things both ſecret and knowne doe I
know, for wiſedome the worker of all things
hath taught it me. <hi>And in the eighth
Chaptet he ſaith,</hi> If any man deſire

how is this done? Even by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Bodies: which Art is gotten and
goes on to perfection by ſtudy, tryall,

But to proceed.<note place="margin">The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time when they meet with the Sun I ſhal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhew, for the lat. of 51. 30.</note> It is a received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
grounded upon long experience,
that the Sun in <hi>Taurus</hi> meeting with the
<hi>Pleyades</hi> and <hi>Heyades</hi> toward the North,
and the <hi>Haedi</hi> or <hi>Kids</hi> towards the South,
and afterwards with <hi>Orion,</hi> and after
with <hi>Arcturus;</hi> all theſe (though they
be by nature ſtormy, tempeſtuous, and
moiſt Conſtillations) doe ſtirre up not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſweet and pleaſant ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which doe freſh the tender-rooted
Plants, being warmed by Southerly
winds.</p>
                     <p>And in the Summer when theſe Plants
have received deep roote, and therefore
need moiſture to further their increaſe
to their full growth, we ſee that the
Sun meets with the <hi>Aſelli</hi> in <hi>Cancer,</hi>
which bring with them ſweet ſhowres,
and a latter Raine to make them proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
then againe, they wanting heat for
their full maturation, the Sun (entring
into <hi>Leo,</hi> being a Signe of the fiery
triplicity, hot and dry) meets with the
two Doggs, <hi>Syrius</hi> and <hi>Procion,</hi> of the
nature of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which bring
great heat to ripen Corne and other
Fruits; this heat notwithſtanding is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119386:26"/>
tempered through the providence of
God by the Eteſian winds, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ariſe at that time of the yeare.
Then againe, the Sun enters the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall
Signe <hi>Virgo,</hi> by nature cold and
dry, which doth ſo abate the heate, that
the earth being now cooler, the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
doth with great eaſe and joy
gather in the fruits of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Then the Sun meeting with ſtormy
Bootes of the nature of <hi>Mars</hi> participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> brings againe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and timely, and ſeaſonable ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to cloſe up the hollow cones of the
gaping earth.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Autumne</hi> the Husbandman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to provide for the Crop for the
next yeare; the qualities of that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being cold and dry, the Sun then
comes to riſe in the Morning, when the
<hi>Pleyades, Hyades,</hi> and <hi>Orion</hi> doe ſet,
which cauſe ſome cold ſhowres, yet
they hurt not the new ſowne Corne;
And why? Even becauſe the Sun is then
in <hi>Sagittary</hi> of the fiery triplicity, hot
and dry. Thus we ſee how it pleaſeth
God to cauſe a ſweet temper and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the nature of the Starres
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119386:26"/>
to pleaſure ſinfull man.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> It ſeemes by this
that the judgement of the weather is
certaine, and by one yeares obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

anſwer.<note place="margin">Solut.</note> That the judgement of the
weather would be certaine hath it
not pleaſed <hi>God</hi> to ſet other <hi>Lights</hi>
for <hi>ſignes,</hi> and for <hi>ſeaſons,</hi> and they
are the <hi>Planets,</hi> with the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<hi>Moone,</hi> whoſe aſpects cauſe ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and divers effects, as we daily
finde by experience; for,</p>
                     <p>1 Their courſe being various doe
continually cauſe a wonderfull
change of weather, even to mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
                     <p>2 Another reaſon may be their
great diſtance from us, they darting
their natures upon us as upon a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and therefore it muſt follow, that
generall influences muſt needs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
particulars; for it may raine in
one place and not in another; here
Snow, and there Haile; and I would
know whether this be any prejudice
to the Art, or elſe unto the Artiſt: It
may be true that the aſpects which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119386:27"/>
are moſt prevalent under ſuch a place
at the time aſpected (conſidering the
circle of Poſition) may happily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the ſame effects, according to
the nature and quality of the Planets
aſpected, though perhaps it falls
otherwiſe in another place, which
is not under the ſame circle, which
divers doe not conſider: yet Artiſts,
as they profeſſe themſelves. <hi>Amos</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Amos 4.</note> 
                        <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 7. Propheſying
againſt the Governours of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
tells them, <hi>That God had with-holden
the raine from them, when it was three
moneths to Harveſt, and I cauſed it to
raine upon one City, and have not cauſed
it to raine upon another City,</hi> but this
was the judgement of God.</p>
                     <p>3 Another reaſon may be, the
curſe of God which fell upon <hi>Adam,</hi>
which deſcended as well upon his
<hi>Iudgement</hi> as <hi>Perſon;</hi> and ſurely ſince
his fall none can attaine to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in any Art, therefore it is
that the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are of ſuch
weak underſtanding and raſh judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that he conſiders not things
to the purpoſe, he conſiders not the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119386:27"/>
moderatours of every quarter of the
Moone, the Winds agreeing to the
ſeaſons of the yeare and place, for it
bloweth not alike in all places, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now then the conſideration of all
theſe things will certainely evince
the ignorant of an apparant errour,<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
that ſay, God never revealed any
ſuch things to man. But I write not
this to fooles, ignorant, or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but to the wiſe and rationall
man. But conſider this, 1. That as
God in his goodneſſe, power, and
wiſedome hath Created all things
in <hi>number, weight,</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> ſo to
us of his great mercy he hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

of thoſe things as he did to

the fourth Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>4 That it is not unlawfull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict

                     <p>1. Defended; <hi>It is not unlawfull

                     <p>But then ſome will ſay, Doth

                     </p>
                     <p>The gloſſe upon the place runs

thus the gloſſe, and therefore they
ſay, 'Tis forbidden.</p>
                     <p>For anſwer hereunto, I ſhal anſwe

as 'tis plaine, that by ſignes there
Rhetoricke will teach us is meant,
the influences of the Signes, by a

naturall Hiſtory, witneſſeth that
<hi>Atlanta</hi> King of the <hi>Mauritanians</hi> was

                  <p>Indeed I read, that <hi>Atlas</hi> who was
King of <hi>Arcadia</hi> was the firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Aſtronomy, from whom a
Mountaine in <hi>Mauritania</hi> takes it
name, and is called <hi>Atlas,</hi> which was
ſo high that the top of it is ſaid
to reach to Heaven, and to ſuſtaine
it, and therefore <hi>Atlas</hi> is ſaid to
beare Heaven upon his ſhoulders,
even by maintaining the Science of
Aſtronomy, he lived, <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi>
2168.</p>
                  <p>Can any man thinke the worſe of
that Science that was invented by
an Heathen, if he were the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And then he goes on,</hi> Of this Art
of Aſtrology <hi>the ſacred Scripture in
divers places makes mention, as</hi>
Deut. 4. 19. And leſt thou lift up thine
eyes to Heaven, and when thou ſeeſt
the Sun, and the Moone, and the Stars,
with all the Hoſt of Heaven, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
be driveu to worſhip them, and
ſerve them, which the Lord thy God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119386:33"/>
hath<note n="*" place="margin">That is, He hath appointed them to ſerve man.</note> diſtributed to all people under the
whole Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Is Aſtrology here forbidden, or
is this Aſtrology? 'Tis farre wide
from it, 'tis not Aſtrology here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
but Idolatry, even the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Heathen, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 2.</p>
                  <p>Then he quotes 47. <hi>Eſay</hi> 13. <hi>Thou
art wearied in the multitude of thy
counſells;</hi> let now the Aſtrologers,
the Starre-gazers, and Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ſtand up, and ſave thee from
theſe things that ſhall come upon
thee.</p>
                  <p>But I pray what Aſtrologers, &amp;c.
were theſe? were they not the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Heathen, ſuch as in the
former verſe were called Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and South-ſayers, who did
put a vaine confidence in ſuch
things.</p>
                  <p>And then he comes to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and tells us what <hi>Franciſeus
Patr. de regno, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. ſpeakes
of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who of all others
was the moſt skilfull in the Art of
Aſtronomy, by which he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119386:33"/>
to predict his owne fate, but
he had not the skill to avoid it. But
what is this to the purpoſe againſt
Aſtrology?</p>
                  <p>And then he tells us what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
ſaith in <hi>lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Metaph. cap.</hi> 4. Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy

doth this make any thing againſt

                  <p>Thus for the defence of Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

muſt not ſtraine himſelfe too high,
that was the fault of the Heathen,
and therefore in Scripture repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Goe to the very eſſence of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
and you ſhall finde that it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119386:34"/>
doth <hi>reaſonably demonſtrate</hi> the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and effects of the naturall
beames of light, and influences of the
Starres and Planets in every <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and elementall body at all

                  <p>By it we learne the riſing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Starres mentioned by <hi>Heſiod,</hi>
by <hi>Virgill</hi> in his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
in his <hi>Medicinall Sphere</hi> to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi>
King of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> by

other famous Philoſophers; a thing
neceſſary for manuring of the earth,
for Navigation, for the alteration of
mans body being whole, ſick, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or bruiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mercerus</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> allow of foure
lawfull uſes of the Coeleſtiall bodies,
to which Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> upon 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> doth
conſent, and they be theſe: Firſt, to
diſtinguiſh day and night, light and
darkneſſe. 2. To be for ſignes of
weather. 3. To ſerve for ſignes and
ſeaſons, as weekes, daies, and yeares.
4 To give influence by their heat,
light, and motion to theſe inferiour
parts. Indeed ſuperſtitious Aſtrology
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119386:34"/>
as <hi>Willet</hi> calls it, is not by any deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but to be (as he faith:) repugnant
to Scripture, againſt reaſon, vaine
and impious, and ſuch Aſtology I
am ſure Maſter <hi>Lilly</hi> doth utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre;
and no ſuch is his Aſtrology
ſpecified and written in his Booke,
called <hi>The Propheticall Merlin,</hi> as ſome
have vainly and fooliſhly imagined.
For his calculations of Nativities,
and finding out things that are loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
&amp;c. which Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> comprehends
under ſuperſtitious Aſtrology, is not
any way practiſed by him in the leaſt
kind of ſuperſtition; for the manner
of his practiſe, I would wiſh this
<hi>Antagoniſt</hi> to looke into his <hi>Anglicus</hi>
for 1646. and he ſhall finde him free
from ſuperſtition; and I would wiſh
thoſe that read his Predictions there
would firſt read his Epiſtle to the
Reader, and I am perſwaded they
will wave their opinion: But it is the
manner of our ignorant Cenſurers
to read the Booke, but leape over the
Epiſtle, thinking that that belongs
not to them; but I am loath to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
too farre though Rhotoricke
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119386:35"/>
allow of it. But for other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and likewiſe ſomewhat what
that famous divine <hi>Meluncthon</hi> writes
concerning judiciall Aſtrology, I
have in part ſhewne before in my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Epiſtle, and therefore I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to reiterate it, and come to
ſpeake two or three words concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the laſt Propoſition, and ſo
conclude.</p>
                  <p>5 That it is not unlawfull to call the
Starres by ſuch and ſuch names. as <hi>Pley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,
Orion, Arcturus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were it ſuperſtition, the Scriptures
would not uſe the words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.
God is there ſaid <hi>to number the Starres,
and call them all by their names:</hi> And
what names? Some are upon Record
in the Scripture, <hi>Job, Amos,</hi> and
others make mention of <hi>Arcturus,
Orion, Pleyades, Heſperus,</hi> and <hi>Lucifer;
Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod</hi> mentioned them,
eſpecially <hi>Syrius,</hi> otherwiſe called
the great <hi>Dog.</hi> The knowledge of
their names as well as of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is very requiſite and uſefull;
Seamen have it by experience in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
their courſe, as <hi>Aratus</hi> who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119386:35"/>
was a <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet, and an Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and <hi>Ovid</hi> 3. <hi>Faſtorum</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
where he ſaith thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Eſſe duas arctos, quarum Cynoſura
petatur,</l>
                     <l>Sidoniis Helieen Graia carina notet.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>For this cauſe <hi>Virgil</hi> in 1 <hi>lib. Georg.</hi>
thinkes that the skilfull Mariner by
the continuall obſervation of ſuch
Starres as might fitly direct him in
his courſe, gave them fit names, for
thus he ſaith:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Navita tum ſtellis m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>meros &amp; nomina
fecit.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Mariner hath both numbred
and named the Starres, but you read
in 147. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that God did this
himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Sure then it can be no ſuperſtition
in theſe times of a great diſcovery of
lights to call the Starres by their
names, though we finde them not all
in holy Writ.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude, let the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119386:36"/>
envious, and cenſorious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
well what I have written and I
hope they will be ſilent; I hope at
leaſt have no cauſe further to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce;
and pray to God that the
Judgements depending in <hi>England</hi>
may be removed, and the good
to the Parliament Predicted may
fully be accompliſhed: Nothing is
certainely (you ſee) Predicted
excluding the providence of the
wiſe Governour of ſublunary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Here Maſter <hi>Lilly</hi> ſpeakes for
himſelfe, and I hope the mouth
of the ſly Detractour will be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
In his <hi>Anglicus</hi> for 1646.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> Anglicus 1646.</note> in
Marches obſervations, where he
writes thus; <hi>I ſpeake as a man that
grounds his conjecture upon naturall
cauſes: poſitively I conclude not, that's
an act belonging to Gods Providence;</hi>
Well weigh likewiſe the places
ſubjected to the twelve ſignes in
Maſter <hi>Booke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> Almanack for 1644.
and I hope thoſe that will not
underſtand will be mute, and thoſe
that cannot apprehend will admire;
and then I hope Maſter <hi>Lillies Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119386:36"/>
apparitions</hi> will ſtartle the
ignorant, his <hi>Collections of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies</hi>
will ſilent the envious, and
his <hi>Propheticall Merlin</hi> will curbe
the cenſorious. Pray then to God
to <hi>avert</hi> his Judgements, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
all to the good predicted for the
true happineſſe and proſperity,
and honour of <hi>Englands</hi>
